# BusNav
BusNav is a smart college bus navigation system that provides real-time bus tracking using map integration. It helps students save time, keeps parents informed through live notifications, and enables colleges to monitor transport safety through driver feedback and complaint features.
📌 Project Description
BusNav is a smart college bus navigation system designed to provide real-time bus tracking using map integration. It helps students save time by showing live bus location and estimated arrival times, keeps parents informed through notifications, and enables colleges to monitor transport safety through driver feedback and complaint mechanisms.

❓ Problem Statement
College transportation systems often lack real-time visibility and effective communication. Students waste valuable time waiting for buses without knowing their arrival status, parents remain anxious due to the absence of journey updates, and colleges lack a structured system to monitor driver behavior and transport safety.

💡 Proposed Solution
BusNav offers a centralized platform where colleges can register buses, students can track live bus locations and ETAs, parents receive real-time notifications, and students can rate drivers or report unsafe driving. This improves efficiency, transparency, safety, and accountability in college transportation.
