# BusNav
BusNav is a smart college bus navigation system that provides real-time bus tracking using map integration. It helps students save time, keeps parents informed through live notifications, and enables colleges to monitor transport safety through driver feedback and complaint features.

** Project Overview
BusNav is a smart, map-based college bus navigation system designed to improve daily transportation for students, parents, and college administration. The system provides real-time bus tracking using Google Maps, estimated arrival times, parent notifications, and a driver feedback mechanism to ensure safety, transparency, and efficient transport management.

This project demonstrates the use of mobile application development, map integration, real-time notifications, and AI-assisted documentation and design.

** Problem Statement
College students often waste time waiting for buses without knowing their real-time location or arrival time. Parents remain anxious due to lack of travel updates, and colleges lack a structured system to monitor driver behavior and transport safety. The absence of a centralized, transparent solution results in inefficiency, safety risks, and poor communication.

* Solution Description
BusNav solves these issues by providing a centralized platform where:
   -Students can track live bus locations and estimated arrival times
   -Parents receive real-time notifications about bus movement
   -Colleges can monitor transport operations and driver behavior
   -Students can submit driver reviews and safety complaints
This ensures time efficiency, improved safety, and better accountability.
